Animator
---
- simply test with jest first
- register node and add specific animation details
  - handle transition and spring separately
- deal with changing surroundings
  - linear from 1 - 100, half way go to 0, then go to 100 again, change speed also every time
  - keep animating even if the layout around it changes
- add additive support at some point
