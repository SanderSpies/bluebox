TODO:
- wrap up as is:
    - add easing types
    - add lots of tests
      - to ensure tree immutability etc.
- forget about Spring types for now
- forget about additive behaviour for now
- research doing less GC when doing animations later

Crazy stuff:
- generate optimal shader which calculates transition / etc itself
    - find transition blocks and find out what's connected to them
    -
- can we differentiate between static and non-static shaders?
